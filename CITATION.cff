  Behavython is an open-source Python-based toolkit designed
  for streamlined analysis and processing of behavioral
  data, with a particular focus on social behavior and
  phenotyping in neuroscience research. Its modular
  framework includes tools for video processing, machine
  learning-based behavior tracking (such as DeepLabCut
  integration), and bout analysis to facilitate rigorous
  data management and analysis workflows. Behavython aims to
  simplify complex behavioral analysis tasks, offering a
  user-friendly GUI and a multi-threaded backend to improve
  performance.
